###Vyper VPN
[Vyper VPN](http://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn) from Golden Frog is a very nice vpn service. They give a free 3 day trial which is really nice because I wanted to verify all would work well with Linux. Their account management via their website is great. I wanted to buy the first month at full price and then choose to pay for a yearly contract to get the discount and I was afraid trying to switch billing frequency would be painful but it is not.

###Get Up and Talk!
I was just adding testing instructions to a story that I was finishing and it took me 5 minutes to write out the instructions for someone who sits 4 desks over. As I was finishing writing the instructions I asked myself why the hell am I doing this and not just putting "See Ben for testing instructions" to generate an actual conversation. I know the QA will have questions because it is a rather complex ticket so we are going to have a conversation anyway. I am pretty sure I just wasted five minutes. 

Seems like I have heard about this somewhere before -> ["Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

###Fugitive.vim
I don't know how many times I am in Vim and ctrl+z to go to the command line to execute Git commands. Yesterday I installed Fugitive and it rocks. Saving more keystrokes and time!
