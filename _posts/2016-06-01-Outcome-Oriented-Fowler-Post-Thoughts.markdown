[Outcome Oriented](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html)

Reading this post reminded me of a team I worked with in the past. This was the approach we took and tried to describe to the rest of the company. We werenâ€™t able to get our message out as nice as [Outcome Oriented](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html) does, but we tried because we believed in it. I enjoyed working with that team. We produced a lot of nice software and did so at a fast pace. I believe it was because we took an outcome oriented approach. As the post describes it takes a certain set of people to work in this manner, but it can be a great way to deliver software.
