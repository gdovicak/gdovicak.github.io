Jenkins
-------
I learned about a [jenkins plugin] (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin) that will commit jenkins configs to git when a change is made. I am installing this am setting it up on a few projects to see how well it works. In theory this is an ideal situation. Hopefully it executes as well as I expect it to.
