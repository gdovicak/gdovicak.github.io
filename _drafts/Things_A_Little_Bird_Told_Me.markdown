Chapter One Page 10
I find it interesting that many of the books I read about entrepreneurs and successful people have exhibited interesting, take charge habits from early in life. The [example](http://books.google.com/books?id=laykAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT14#v=onepage&q=lacrosse&f=false) from this book is the author said he formed is own lacrosse team at his high school. To me, that would take some serious courage and work to get a sports team off of the ground from nowhere. This leads me to believe that in most (not all) cases people are born with the abilities and drive to create and do great things. I believe it is possible to learn this but it is very difficult to do. Even when someone learns how to lead and build a business my guess is that it takes an even more unique person who was born with the ability to change themselves into something else that they want to be. Either way, it takes a special person.
