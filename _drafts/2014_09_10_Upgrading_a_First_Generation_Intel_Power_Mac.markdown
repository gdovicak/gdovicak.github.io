I was lucky enough to have been given a first generation Intel Power Mac. This computer is also known as a Mac Pro 1, 1. It has dual xeon 2.66 processors and is overall a pretty sweet machine, even for being built in 2006. The only problem that I had with this machine is that I could not install any OS after OS X 10.7 using the standard apple means of OS distribution (disk, app store, memory stick). Many programs worked on this version of the OS, but there were a couple that I used frequently that didn't run at all. I started looking for solutions.
