I have been fortunate over the past couple of years to work for two different companies that are in support of working remote at least part of time. I never realized how much a couple of days working from home can tilt the work life balance more towards the life side of the scale.

Over the past couple of years there has been a shift in philosophy on employees working remote from the company I work(ed)* for. 


*The company I worked for, Easy2 Technologies, was acquired and working remote has been allowed by both Easy2 and the acquiring comapny.
