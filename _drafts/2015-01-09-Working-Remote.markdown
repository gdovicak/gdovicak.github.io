I am allowed to work remote, sometimes, and I really appreciate it. Over the past several years there has been a lot of discussion about the pros and cons of working remotely. There has been [books](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17316682-remote?from_search=true) written about it. There have been many discussions amongst managers and other higher ups about whether it will help or hurt productivity. I am going to just give my thoughts about working remote and why I appreciate it so much.

I love to work. I love programming, interracting with my team, and delivering great software. Even though I love all these things, at the end of the day the reason I work is to make sure my home/personal life is as enjoyable as possible using the benefits from my job. That is the primary reason that I work. I understand this isn't everyone's motive for working, but it is mine.

Because of this reason anything that can help tip the scales towards the "life" side of work/life balance is greatly appreciated. Being able to work from home when needed has allowed me to be there for my wife and family at no cost to my employers. I more than fulfill my duties when I work from home, possibly becaues I feel like I have to prove that working remote works great. 

When I work remote I feel like more of a 'family man'. I am available to change a diaper, burp a baby, or help pack the car for a trip for my wife and kids. Doing these sorts of things may sound like things that you shouldn't do while you are "working", but what I don't do is walk to Starbucks to get a coffee and play video games with my co-workers. I am not spending less time working, but I am spending time that I normally use to "blow off steam" to spend with my family. This is valuable to me. Many times when working remote I actually spend more time working because the time I normally dedicate to a commute I now spend hacking away at some code.

What I miss about working remote is the time that I get with my co-workers. That is why I really enjoy the hybrid remote/in-office scenario. 




The past two companies that I have worked for have allowed me to work remote if I have any need to be at home during the day as long as I can fulfill my duties. They ask that I come to the office on a regular basis, but if the cable guy is going to be at my house, if my kid has a function over lunch, or if the weather is bad, I can work from home. Them allowing me to do this has really tipped the scales in favor of the "life" side of the equation. It is amazing to me how much I appreciate being able to work at home, or from anywhere else that I can accomplish my duties.

PROS
-Enjoy working at home because of family.
-Less stress in case of home life events
-More productive because of a lack of interruptions
-Lunch with my family
-More productive because I end up spending time programming that I would normally be commuting.


CONS
-I miss interacting with the people I enjoy
-miss overhearing conversations that lead to ideas

My team is remote, so what is the difference.
